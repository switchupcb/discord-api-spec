# Contribution

This specification uses **DiscordGen** to generate JSON and Go structs from [discord-api-types](https://github.com/discordjs/discord-api-types); which provides up-to-date Typescript Types for the Discord API. **DiscordGen** will remain proprietary at this time, but may be open sourced later. If you would like to use **DiscordGen** or convert other TypeScript Type Libraries to JSON/Go, please contact `software@switchupcb.com`.

## Issues

Issues with `unconverted` Typescript should be reported to [discord-api-types](https://github.com/discordjs/discord-api-types). Issues with converted Go structs (from validated JSON) should be reported to [json-to-go](https://github.com/mholt/json-to-go).
