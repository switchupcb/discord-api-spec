# Discord API Spec
Discord does **NOT** provide an API Specification. This repository aims to provide a human and machine readable [Discord API](https://discord.com/developers/docs/reference) Specification. The `json` folder contains valid JSON while `submodule` folders refer to programming language object-definition libraries.

## How is it Created?

Read [Contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information or to contribute to the specification.

## What can I do with this?

A machine readable specification will allow you to generate language types _(i.e Go Structs)_ and other related code programmatically. This makes creating and updating a feature-complete [API Wrapper Library](https://discord.com/developers/docs/topics/community-resources#libraries-discord-libraries) low-effort and simple.

## What is the alternative?

The current alternative Discord provides is to use an outdated contributor-led documentation. Discord API documentation does not provide JSON responses, and there is no guarantee that its `Object` tables are up-to-date nor standardized.
